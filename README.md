# Curated TV and Film

The purpose of the project is to show a curated list of Modern TV shows or Films, where iconic scenes that include speeches, action scenes, classic quotes, etc. These can all be viewed easily and quickly to help in reference. Especially useful in arguments.

These scenes are carefully picked out moments, ignoring bias of any opinions or beliefs. So please be aware that because of this, certain links may cause offense.
