## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

### Jest

Tests are found in `./src/__tests__` and to run tests across the project use the following command:

```bash
npm test (yarn test)
```

_Tests are also run on a pre-commit hook to make sure tests are updated along with commits and don't break the build._

To know more about testing go to [MORE](MORE.md)

### Snapshots

Along with the Jest tests are snapshots. These are essentially for UI testing how your components are rendered. Any unexpected changes to your components will cause the snapshot tests to fail.

Provided that the components have been rendered correctly, you can fix and update the snapshot tests by pressing 'u' whilst the watch mode is being run. This will then update and re-run the tests to show you the passing state of your tests.

## Prettier linting

The JavaScript files can be prettyfied using [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) with the following command:

```bash
npm run lint (yarn run lint)
```

Configuration for Prettier is found in [.prettierrc](.prettierrc).

The project also has pre-commit hooks for when code is commited to your local branches that will trigger this linting across the project.
