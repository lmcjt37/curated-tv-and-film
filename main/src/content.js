He is asked by a college student a simple question during a campus debate. 'What makes America the greatest country in the world?'.

The evidence that is out there today is to the contrary and he discloses such information in his argument. We used to be the worlds best of the best and now we are just pretending. The first step to solving a problem is to admit there is one.",
